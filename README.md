### Journal #1: Setting up a Smart TV
#### Kailey Stauble, March 5, 2021

Recently, I had to set up a smart TV which includes providing a substantial amount of information, especially due to the fact that the user is required to set up an account with the TV brand. My own goal as a user when setting up this television was to complete the set up process as quickly as possible in order to be able to actually use the television. The setup requires network information to be entered in order to connect to the internet, a login username and password, a location, among other information that must be entered using the remote control that comes with the television. On the screen, the user is provided with a "keyboard" that can be traversed using the arrow keys on the remote control, which is simple enough to use if not a litle slow. On this particular television, once a letter was chosen on the on-screen keyboard, a small menu appears with a few options: a check mark to confirm the letter, a button to delete the letter, and a few other letter options that are guesses to which letter you may need next to save the time of navigating to it. The problem with this function is that the user does not make enough mistakes while typing to necessitate a delete button as soon as they type a letter, nor do they need to confirm the letter as moving on to a different letter will complete the same task. The pop up menu made it difficult to move away from the current letter and onto a new one as the arrow keys of the remote control had to bypass the menu before doing so, making an extra click necessary to move on. Also, frequently the suggested letters in this menu were not even correct, making it a further annoyance. In addition to this, as a new user I was unsure of what the menu was meant for and did not take the time to investigate it right away, which led to annoyance at its existence as it seemed to only slow me down when trying to type out a word. This menu was meant to make the process of typing more **efficient**, but it actually did the oppposite in that it required an extra click to move away from each letter. In this sense, efficient means that the user should be able to complete the task of entering information such as an email address or password as quickly as possible and without interference from the product. Once I did take a moment to realize what the letter "suggestions" in the menu were for, I was able to utilize them once or twice but as stated previously, there were only one or two letters suggested and they were frequently wrong, so it was rare that I was actually able to use the menu for its intended purpose. There is an easy fix to this problem: get rid of the menu pop-up. The idea itself sounds like it may save the user time, but in actuality it caused me to have to click twice to move on to a new letter, blocked other letters from view, and was generally more annoying than it was useful.
